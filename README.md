# ML-APA
Repository for storing my practice exercises for Machine Learning: A Probablistic Approach, by Kevin Murphy.
In some cases, I have gone beyond the scope of the required exercises, as an opportunity to practice my Python,
by implementing some of the modules that were provided by the book in MATLAB from scratch.

## Usage

1. Within the repo for each chapter, make a >=3.6 Python venv.
2. Install all requirements with `make install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download any required datasets with `make data`.
4. Each module is created to solve an exercise or exercises. They are directly executable with `python`.
